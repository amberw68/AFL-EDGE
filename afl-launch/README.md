## About

`afl-launch` is a simple program to spawn afl fuzzing instances from the
command line. It provides no compelling features; it is simply my version of
this tool.

```
Usage of afl-launch:
  -XXX
        [HACK] substitute XXX in the target args with an 8 char random string [HACK]
  -f string
        Filename template (substituted and passed via -f)
  -i string
        afl-fuzz -i option (input location)
  -m string
        afl-fuzz -m option (memory limit), 'none' for no limit (defaults to afl)
  -n int
        Number of instances to launch (default 1)
  -name string
        Base name for instances. Fuzzers will work in <output>/<BASE>-[M|S]<N>
  -no-master
        Launch all instances with -S
  -o string
        afl-fuzz -o option (output location)
  -t string
        afl-fuzz -t option (timeout)
  -x string
        afl-fuzz -x option (extras location)
```

The launcher DOES NOT CHECK if the `afl-fuzz` instance errored out. Before
starting a multiple launch, you should start `afl-fuzz` once manually with your
desired `-i` `-o` `-x` (etc) options to make sure everything works.

If you don't supply a base name, the launcher will pick a random one.

Example:
```
./afl-launch -i ~/testcases/pdf -o ~/fuzzing/pdf -n 4  -- pdftoppm @@
```

A note on the `-f` flag - the idea is that you pass a template like
`/dev/shm/whatever.xml` and the launcher will substitute it as `-f
/dev/shm/<BASENAME>-S12.xml` when it invokes `afl-fuzz`. This is so that you can
have AFL create testcase files on a ramdisk, and avoid stressing your disks.
Queue entries and crashes are still saved as usual in the location specified
by `-o`. Don't be an idiot like me and run everything on a ramdisk.

Another note about ttys - this tool just spawns all the processes and then
exits. If you want them to stay running unattended then the easiest and (IMHO)
best way is just to run it inside a `screen` session (`man screen`).

### -XXX

There is a hacky option that can be used for a few things. If you pass -XXX
then the literal string `XXX` anywhere in the target command (after the `--`
in the command line) will be replaced with a random 8 character string. I use
this for targets that require a `-o` flag for output filename, like
`stupidprogram -i @@ -out /dev/shm/XXX.jpg`.

### They launched.. now what?

Use `afl-whatsup <LOCATION>` with the same location you used for -o to get the
afl-fuzz summary output. For bonus points, be a unix nerd and do like `watch
-n 60 afl-whatsup -s ~/fuzzing/targetname`

This is what that looks like:
```
Every 60.0s: afl-whatsup -s ~/fuzzing/targetname Sun Jun  7 10:40:36 2015
